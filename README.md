# ASP.NET Core Application CI/CD Pipeline with Terraform and Azure DevOps

This repository demonstrates a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for an ASP.NET Core application, leveraging Azure DevOps, Docker, and Terraform. The project showcases how to build, test, and deploy a .NET application to Azure using infrastructure as code.

## Documentation on Work Done and Future Improvements

### What Has Been Done

- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - A complete CI/CD pipeline has been set up using Azure Pipelines. The pipeline includes stages for building, testing, and deploying an ASP.NET Core application.
  - The application is built from source, packaged into a Docker image, and then deployed to both test and production environments hosted on Azure App Services.

- **Infrastructure as Code**:
  - Terraform has been used to define and manage the infrastructure as code. The resources provisioned include Azure Resource Groups, Azure Container Registry (ACR), App Service Plans, and App Services for both the test and production environments.
  - The Terraform backend is configured to store the state in Azure Blob Storage, ensuring that the state is securely managed and consistent across environments.

- **Automation**:
  - The entire process, from building the application to deploying it to different environments, has been automated as much as possible using Azure DevOps.
  - Pre-deployment and post-deployment validation tests are included to ensure that the application functions correctly after deployment.

### What Would Be Done with More Time

- **Advanced Deployment Strategies**:
  - Implement blue-green deployments or canary releases to minimize downtime and reduce the risk associated with deploying new versions of the application.
  - Set up automated rollback strategies in case a deployment fails validation tests.

- **Enhanced Monitoring and Logging**:
  - Integrate application performance monitoring (APM) tools such as Azure Application Insights to provide deeper insights into application health and performance.
  - Improve logging strategies, including centralized logging using Azure Log Analytics, to monitor and troubleshoot issues more effectively.

- **Security Enhancements**:
  - Implement managed identities for Azure resources instead of service principals to improve security.
  - Enforce stricter network security rules, such as using Azure Firewall or Network Security Groups (NSGs), to limit access to the application and backend resources.
  - Enable HTTPS enforcement and ensure that all communications between components are encrypted.

### Security of the Application and Best Practices

- **Authentication and Authorization**:
  - Use Azure Active Directory (AAD) for managing authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can access the application and its resources.
  - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for resources in Azure to ensure that users have the minimum required permissions.

- **Data Protection**:
  - Store sensitive data in Azure Key Vault and reference it in the application configuration to prevent exposure of secrets in the codebase or environment variables.
  - Ensure that all data in transit is encrypted using TLS, and consider encrypting data at rest using Azure Storage Service Encryption (SSE).

- **Application Security**:
  - Regularly update the application dependencies to the latest secure versions to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
  - Implement security testing, such as static code analysis (SCA) and dynamic application security testing (DAST), as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

- **Infrastructure Security**:
  - Use infrastructure-as-code security tools (e.g., Terraform-compliance, Sentinel) to enforce security policies on the Terraform code before applying changes.
  - Regularly review and audit the permissions and access policies for Azure resources to ensure compliance with security best practices.

### Disaster Recovery (DR) and Business Continuity Planning (BCP) Considerations

- **Disaster Recovery (DR)**:
  - Set up geo-redundant storage for the application and database backups to ensure data is replicated across regions.
  - Implement automated backup strategies for critical components such as databases, configuration files, and state files. Consider using Azure Backup or third-party tools for this purpose.
  - Test the disaster recovery plan regularly to ensure that the application can be restored quickly in case of a failure.

- **Business Continuity Planning (BCP)**:
  - Design the application architecture to be highly available, using Azure's availability zones and load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple instances.
  - Implement failover mechanisms to ensure that if one component of the application fails, traffic is automatically redirected to a healthy instance or a backup region.
  - Document the BCP process, including recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO), and ensure that all stakeholders are aware of the procedures.

- **Future Improvements**:
  - Explore multi-cloud strategies to reduce dependency on a single cloud provider and increase resilience.
  - Consider setting up a cold or warm standby environment in another Azure region to be activated in case the primary region experiences an outage.
  - Regularly review and update the DR and BCP plans as the application and infrastructure evolve.

By following these practices and continuously improving the application and infrastructure, you can ensure that the system is secure, resilient, and capable of recovering quickly from unexpected disruptions.
